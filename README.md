# Used-Car-Price-Prediction-Model
Built a machine learning model to predict used car prices based on features like year, fuel type, transmission, and current market price. Applied data preprocessing techniques, feature encoding, and scaling. Trained and evaluated Linear, Ridge, and Lasso regression models using GridSearchCV to optimize performance.
